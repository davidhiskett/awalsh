                <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The admin dashboard at Yaspa is a crucial B2B communication tool, documenting data on open banking transactions.</p>

<p>With a growing list of complaints, and new features being planned, there was a need to improve the dashboard with scalability in mind. Originally designed by the development team, the dashboard was built with only a few UX patterns in mind, which were based on assumption and never tested. As features have been added, so has the number of issues requiring short term fixes. Being a crucial stage in securing new contracts, improving the dashboard would also bring a welcomed update to sales collateral.</p>

<p>I was brought on board to tackle this redesign. I was the only designer on the project, working alongside a product manager, business analyst, data scientist, three front end developers and two testers. With further input from several other stakeholders.</p>

<h2 id="problem">PROBLEM</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple redundant and faulty features were presenting a poor user experience.</li>
  <li>Little consideration for UX led to inefficient layout and problematic navigation.</li>
  <li>Outdated and inconsistent visual design was impacting general experience and brand image.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">GOALS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Update Ul to match current standards and incorporate updated brand assets - aiming for clarity, consistency and brand trustworthiness.</li>
  <li>Provide clear insights with better visualisation and reporting of transaction data.</li>
  <li>Improve usability through simplified layouts and navigation which supports expansion.</li>
  <li>Recognise accessibility standards in our design and development process.</li>
  <li>Create a design system that can facilitate future development.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="existing-dashboard">EXISTING DASHBOARD</h3>
<p>Before reviewing any existing research that had been conducted, my initial focus was to review the dashboard in its current state, to ensure I was approaching this task objectively. I took screenshots of every section, observing what in my view worked, didn’t work, or appeared to be missing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/admin-dashboard/existing-dashboard-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="interviews">INTERVIEWS</h3>
<p>Prior to joining the company, a design colleague had conducted interviews with three merchants who had recently integrated with Yaspa. These customers were asked open ended questions regarding their recent experience with the dashboard. A standout finding from this was checking the status of a transaction was a crucial task. It was also reported that some filters do not work reliably, and more analytics on both customers and transactions would be helpful.</p>

<p>As a product team we then spoke internally to the compliance, customer support and sales teams to get an assessment of how our colleagues, and the customers they spoke to daily, experienced the dashboard. Below is a summary of the points we discovered.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/admin-dashboard/interviews-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="market-research">MARKET RESEARCH</h3>
<p>We conducted some market research to evaluate current visual and UX standards, with a particular focus on payments dashboards. We kept a communal board of screenshots, which I sorted by product and then further divided into specific areas to help with pages we were designing. From this analysis, we found Stripe, GoCardless and Checkout.com useful in relevance and interesting design. This board was added to and used frequently by the whole team throughout the whole project.</p>

<p>We progressed with a collection of confirmed problems and an idea of how we wanted to reshape the dashboard, and we defined requirements for each section on confluence. For areas we were less certain about, including a new customers page, we held design workshops to outline what we knew, what was possible, and what had been requested. We also met with the front end team regularly to confirm expectations and functional requirements.</p>

<h3 id="layout-exploration">LAYOUT EXPLORATION</h3>
<p>Different options for general structure and navigation were considered, but from our research a main left navigation side bar was common and felt the most appropriate for future growth of the dashboard. This would free up the page header to be used for extra content, and provide space for future pages to be added underneath.</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/admin-dashboard/layout-exploration-4.png" />
</div>

<h3 id="wireframes">WIREFRAMES</h3>
<p>We created and reviewed wireframes for each section of the dashboard, below is a snapshot of this process. Regular feedback sessions were conducted within the product team, then larger ones with the front end developers, testers and CTO. The high fidelity designs were then shown to internal teams and we collectively processed and dealt with often conflicting requests.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="final-designs">FINAL DESIGNS</h3>
<p>After collecting relevant feedback from all teams, I laid out the final designs in order of priority as set out by the development team. This involved a handoff with the front event developers and testers, to intercept any last minute uncertainties and tickets written in conjunction with the product manager. This was a fluid and collaborative process with the front end developers, reviewing designs with me before they were handed to the testing team.</p>

<p>During this project, the marketing team also carried out a brand refresh. I worked with marketing to ensure we incorporated the updated colours, logo and design into the dashboard. We then worked collaboratively on an updated sign in screen for the dashboard, to complement the new website.</p>

<h3 id="testing">TESTING</h3>
<p>As this was a redesign project, we carried over most of the functionality from the existing dashboard. Our aim with testing was therefore to ensure this functionality had been preserved. One challenge we came up against was a lack of documentation for existing functionality. Our initial task was therefore to work closely with our business analyst to set a list of user scenarios which we needed to check. This massively improved our process for the future. Due to time constraints and a lack of willing customers to test the design with, we are also still in the process of collecting feedback on the dashboard, which will be encouraged through a feedback button and survey form on the main side bar.</p>

<h3 id="reflection">REFLECTION</h3>
<p>It was great to work on this project at a new company, and contribute to improving process at a busy startup. This is an ongoing project, and after we release the dashboard, our attention is shifting to small fixes that still need doing and new sections that are being developed. I do see many areas for improvement and have kept a list of ideas which I consistently add to, for example I would personally like to see more of the brand update making its way into the dashboard in certain areas and would enjoy working with the marketing team to make this happen. I also would like to engage with customers to collect more meaningful feedback.</p>
