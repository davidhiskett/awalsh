                <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Within the ARKK automation platform users build out financial processes which house different types of activities they need to complete those processes. Alongside the Head of Design and one other Product Designer, I was responsible for the UI Design in our redesign of the central process page where users review the progress of their activities and complete important tasks.</p>

<h2 id="problem">PROBLEM</h2>
<p>The existing design for a process page was old/outdated, but also presented various limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users lacked any sort of navigation within a process, which consisted of a list of activities on expandable cards.</li>
  <li>Multiple activities could be expanded simultaneously, which often meant important details were pushed out of view and could not be viewed in context.</li>
  <li>Users had to engage in significant amounts of scrolling, whilst also open then close activities to bring relevant information into view.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals">GOALS</h2>
<p>We wanted to improve the layout of what is one of the most important pages on the platform, along with refresh the design to be more in line with updates done elsewhere. We needed to create more order to help users asses and get at what they needed more quickly.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce navigation within a process view.</li>
  <li>List more high level information about activities without needling to open them.</li>
  <li>Introduce filtering and sorting of activities.</li>
  <li>View activities alongside important data.</li>
</ul>

    </div>
</div>

<p>As this was a big project with many different parts, we created a couple of kickoff boards in different meetings. Above is a board from the early stages of the process for the main redesign, along with some requirements.</p>

<h3 id="old-view">OLD VIEW</h3>
<div class="no-border">
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-old-1.png" />
</div>
<p>We then carried out a detailed assessment of the current page, mainly focusing on UX and UI issues, but also what worked. We added to this list as we spoke to people in different teams to build a more accurate picture of how we could improve the process page.</p>

<h3 id="interviews">INTERVIEWS</h3>
<div class="row mb8 no-border">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-interviews-1.png" />
    </div>
</div>
<p>Within the company we have a ‘Services’ team who set up various workflows for customers. In this sense they represent a certain type of user to us, who also has valuable insight into the motivations and experiences of customers. I was responsible for speaking to a few of these individuals as part of our initial user research.  Above are snapshots from an interview with one member of the Services team, and another from the Product team.</p>

<h3 id="filter-research">FILTER RESEARCH</h3>
<div class="row mb8">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-filter-research-1.png" />
    </div>
</div>
<p>We worked collectively on the whole process for this project, dividing up responsibilities on certain tasks. One of the specific areas I took responsibility of was the filters. Off the back of various interviews and market research, we tried out some different approaches for filtering.</p>

<div class="row three-column one-mobile no-border">
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-filter-research-2.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-filter-research-3.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-filter-research-4.png" />
</div>
<p>Through testing and feedback sessions of the above ideas, we settled on an overlay menu, which would allow users to add detailed filters in rows. We concluded that we didn’t have enough space to line filter results up as chips, agreeing that it was best to hide applied filters from the default view. The details of any applied filters were also accessible in one click, and could be edited or removed from there.</p>

<h3 id="page-layout-exploration">PAGE LAYOUT EXPLORATION</h3>
<div class="row two-column">
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-wireframes-1.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-wireframes-2.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-wireframes-3.png" />
    <img src="/assets/img/navigation-redesign/navigation-wireframes-4.png" />
</div>
<p>I took full responsibility of the UI for the project alongside the filter work. These are some early layout exploration based on initial UX work that was conducted. I made sure to work alongside the lead Product Designer in their research, so we could present some early designs before we were set on one approach.</p>
