### OVERVIEW
Within the ARKK automation platform users build out financial processes which house different types of activities they need to complete those processes. In a team alongside the Head of Design and one other Product Designer, I was responsible for the UI Design in our redesign of the central process page where users review the progress of their activities and complete important tasks.

### PROBLEM
The existing design for a process page was old/outdated, but also present various limitations:
- Users lacked any sort of navigation within a process, which consisted of a list of activities on expandable cards.
- Multiple activities could be expanded simultaneously, which often meant important details were pushed out of view and could not be viewed in context. 
- Users had to engage in significant amounts of scrolling to open then close activities was occurring to access important information.

### GOALS
We wanted to improve the layout of what is one of the most important pages on the platform, along with update the design to be more in line with updates done elsewhere. We needed to project an organised feel to help users asses and get at what they needed quicker.
- Introduce navigation within a process view. 
- List more high level information about activities without needling to open them. 
- Introduce filtering and sorting of activities 
- View activities alongside important data. Better use of space.
