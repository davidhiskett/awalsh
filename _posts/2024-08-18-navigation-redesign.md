### OVERVIEW
Within the ARKK automation platform users build out financial processes which house different types of activities they need to complete those processes. In a team alongside the Head of Design and one other Product Designer, I was responsible for the UI Design in our redesign of the central process page where users review the progress of their activities and complete important tasks.

### PROBLEM
The existing design for a process page was old/outdated, but also present various limitations:
- Users lacked any sort of navigation within a process, which consisted of a list of activities on expandable cards.
- Multiple activities could be expanded simultaneously, which often meant important details were pushed out of view and could not be viewed in context. 
- Users had to engage in significant amounts of scrolling to open then close activities was occurring to access important information.
