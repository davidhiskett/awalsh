## OVERVIEW

Backed by BBC Children in Need's ‘A Million & Me’ initiative, social enterprise Parent Zone created a ‘digital friend’ Ollee, which aims to help children aged 8-13 express their feelings. In my role as Digital Designer, I created the core branding for the app, from which a design agency could build the final product.

Final assets included logo, colour scheme and typography, which were all documented in brand guidelines. I also created an early prototype of Ollee from low fidelity wireframes that was presented during meetings to communicate the purpose of the app before it existed, and help agencies build their pitch back to Parent Zone.

## PROBLEM

High cases of anxiety, depression and trauma amongst children have created a crisis in children’s mental health and wellbeing. With funding from Children in Need, many companies sought to address this problem. Ollee encourages children to recognise their emotions on difficult topics and communicate those thoughts with adults around them.

## GOALS
To create an identity for Ollee that was approachable, to honour the sensitive nature of the app.
- Create a logo
- Assemble a colour scheme
- Select typography
- Create Brand guidelines to build Ollee

### wireframes & early prototype
Our initial task was to create an early concept for Ollee. This was done by building an interactive prototype from hand drawn sketches provided by the project lead. We decided on some basic flows to demonstrate a child reporting they were first ‘quite worried’, and then secondly ‘very worried’ to show the varying levels of response we imagined Ollee giving for those different scenarios.

</div>

### logo development
As Ollee was something to confide in, we needed an approachable and positive feeling logo. We also decided very early on that the full name ‘Ollee’ should be present in the logo for visibility.

### Colour development
Some colour developments placed into mock mobile screens and alongside logo ideas to give a sense of how they could work.

#### Testing typography

#### Final typography

The intention behind our typography choices was to be very straight forward for main body text, with a slightly animated feel in headings to maintain that approachable feel.
